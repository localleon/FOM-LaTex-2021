@article{Anton.2017,
  abstract = {The increasing interconnectivity of industrial networks is one of the central current hot topics. It is adressed by research institutes, as well as industry. In order to perform the fourth industrial revolution, a full connectivity between production facilities is necessary. Due to this connectivity, however, an abundance of new attack vectors emerges. In the National Reference Project for Industrial IT-Security (IUNO), these risks and threats are addressed and solutions are developed. These solutions are especially applicable for small and medium sized enterprises that have not as much means in staff as well as money as larger companies. These enterprises should be able to implement the solutions without much effort. The security solutions are derived from four use cases and implemented prototypically. A further topic of this work are the research areas of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence that address the given challenges, as well as the solutions developed in the context of IUNO. Aside from the project itself, a method for distributed network data collection aggregation is presented, as a prerequisite for anomaly detection for network security.},

@article{Vielberth.2020,
  abstract = {Since the introduction of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) around 15 years ago, their importance has grown significantly, especially over the last five years. This is mainly due to the paramount necessity to prevent major cyber incidents and the resulting adoption of centralized security operations in businesses. Despite their popularity, existing academic work on the topic lacks a generally accepted view and focuses mainly on fragments rather than looking at it holistically. These shortcomings impede further innovation. In this paper, a comprehensive literature survey is conducted to collate different views. The discovered literature is then used to determine the current state-of-the-art of SOCs and derive primary building blocks. Current challenges within a SOC are identified and summarized. A notable shortcoming of academic research is its focus on the human and technological aspects of a SOC while neglecting the connection of these two areas by specific processes (especially by non-technical processes). However, this area is essential for leveraging the full potential of a SOC in the future.},
